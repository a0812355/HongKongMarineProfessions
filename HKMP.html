                <p><h4>Job Description:</h4>Fisheries refer to the types of fisheries engaged in fishing operations within 12 miles of territorial waters, with or without boats and rafts.</p>
                <p><h4>Background History:</h4> Before the foundation of Hong Kong(1842), fishing was the first industry in HK, and most Hong Kong citizens relied on the fishing industry for their livelihood. The rest of the time they spent resting, living, and eating on the boats, hence the nickname "water people". The fisheries industry was at its peak in the 1960s and 1970s, but it was not until the 1970s and 1980s that Hong Kong began to become industrialized, with frequent reclamation projects and rapid development into an international metropolis, that the fisheries industry declined. As a result, the fisheries industry declined and many fishermen switched to the industrial and commercial sectors. The reclamation along the coastline forced many fishermen to relocate to the land, and the "watermen" became increasingly rare. Their boat-based culture and characteristics were gradually eliminated by the development, and the few that remained became the figures to carry on the torch.</p>
                <p><h4>Job Requirements: </h4> Registration for Local Fishing Vessels.</p>

                <p>1.Marine and coastal ecosystems are facing many new problems that have not been recognized or understood, and each problem has the potential to affect marine biodiversity, pollution issues such as the impact of new biodegradable materials on the marine environment, and ecological damage Problems such as the impact of wildfires on coastal ecosystems, overfishing in mid-ocean waters, and the movement of marine species away from the equatorial tropics due to climate change or global warming have all in turn led to a decline in tropical biodiversity, resulting in some of the world's most marine biodiversity The richest areas, including the Coral Triangle, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, are also at risk of reduced species richness. Climate change has also caused problems such as ocean acidification, rising ocean temperatures, and rising sea levels, posing threats to marine biological resources and the ecological environment, and also posing difficulties to marine scientific research and management.</p>
                <p>2.Public awareness and concern about marine science and conservation still need to be improved. Strengthening marine science education and publicity and improving public awareness and awareness of marine issues are challenges facing the marine scientific research and management industry.</p>
    
                <h3>Future development possibilities:</h3>
                <p>The development of new technologies, such as soft robots and upgraded seabed tracking systems, will help scientists better understand marine species and their distribution, and more effectively help the development of marine protected areas</p>
